# A Use Case Lens on Digital Cultural Heritage

This project shows a selection of use cases based on the [European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage](https://www.echoes-eccch.eu) (ECCCH). It provides a collection of Jupyter Notebooks describing how the use cases are created including details about the data reused, the extraction, process and integration with EU research data infrastructures.

## Use cases

The following picture shows how existing platforms and services are integrated to create the use cases in the ECCCH , to foster excellence in data and Digital Commons. Note that this figure was inspired by the ECHOES project website and tries to illustrate how our approach fits within the current research data infrastructure.
